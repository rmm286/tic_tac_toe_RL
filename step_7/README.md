### Step 7: Evaluating and Visualizing Agent Performance

**Objective**: Evaluate the performance of the trained agent and visualize its learning progress.

**Instructions**:
- Track the outcomes (win/loss/draw) of games during training.
- Use `matplotlib` to plot the agent's performance over time.

**Starting Material**:
- Win/loss/draw counters in the training loop.
- Basic plotting with `matplotlib`.
