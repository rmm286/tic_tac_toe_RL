### Step 8: Iterating and Improving

**Objective**: Iterate on your implementation to improve the agent's performance.

**Instructions**:
- Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, epsilon).
- Try more advanced RL techniques like Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

**Starting Material**:
- Initial Q-learning implementation.
- Basic knowledge of neural networks for DQN.
