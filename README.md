# Tic Tac Toe RL

### Problem Description: Game Playing (Tic-Tac-Toe)
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to achieve some goal. A classic and simple problem to solve using RL is the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. This game is a good starting point because of its simplicity and well-defined rules.

### Game Setup
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their marks (either 'X' or 'O') in an empty cell. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all cells are filled and no player has aligned three marks, the game is a draw.

## Reinforcement Learning Basics
To apply RL, we need the following components:

Environment: The Tic-Tac-Toe board and its rules.

Agent: The RL model that will learn to play the game.

States: Representations of the game board at each step.

Actions: Placing a mark in an empty cell.

Reward: Feedback to the agent. For example, +1 for a win, -1 for a loss, and 0 for a draw or ongoing game.

Policy: The strategy that the agent uses to decide actions based on states.

## Getting Started
### Requirements
Programming Language: Python is commonly used for RL projects.

Libraries: Libraries like numpy for handling arrays and gym for creating the game environment.

RL Algorithm: Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are good starting points.

### Setup
Install Libraries: Install Python libraries (numpy, gym).

Environment Setup: Implement or use an existing Tic-Tac-Toe environment.

Agent Implementation: Code the RL agent using Q-learning or DQN.
Training: Train the agent by letting it play against itself or a predefined strategy.

Evaluation: Test the trained agent's performance.
